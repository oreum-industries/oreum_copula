# Manually created as-at 2022-02-15
# Last updated as-at 2025-01-24
# NOTES:
#  + Creates a virtual env for project development
#  + Require running on Apple Silicon ARM64 (NOT Intel x86 AMD64 CPU via Rosetta2)
#  + Install with mamba via Makefile, there's also a fuller set of deps to be
#    installed by pip in the pyproject.toml
#  + numpy not strictly needed here because it's brought in by pymc but because
#    we're explicit about BLAS/LAPACK from acccelerate, then also numpy.
#    also see https://numpy.org/install/ and https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24053
